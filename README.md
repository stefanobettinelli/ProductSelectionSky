#Sky Programming Test

This is the implementation of the Sky programming test for the product selection application.

I used **java version 8** along with **Spring Boot**, so it's necessary to have a jdk version 1.8

##### Usage: use one of this methods

- **With IDE**: it's a maven project so any Java modern modern IDE should be able to import it correctly.
    from the IDE run the `ProductSelectionSkyApplication` which is the entry point with the main method. I personally used Intellj for the development.
- **mvn install**: use the maven "`mvn install`" comand to build a jar and then use the command "`java -jar <jar_file_name>`" which will launch the app

Once the app is running it uses the default Spring Boot port so it can accessed on `http://localhost:8080/`
